# HILL-CLIMB-RACING-TRAINER-2
This is the trainer of Hill Climb Racing and it grants you free modification to Coins &amp; Diamond. The good thing about this is that I made it myself using "Python". So, you don't have to worry about VIRUSES. The Windows may detect it as a virus but be assured that this ain't no virus. Code will also be provided

# HOW TO USE?
Step 1: Open the game

Step 2: Open the app (trainer)

(The trainer will automatically show you the coind & diamonds you currently have)

Step 3: Just edit the value on the app and click on "Set"

Step 4: That's it. ENJOY!!

Note: The infinite fuel mod will take a 4 second delay each time you start a race so it may get annoying. To resolve this annoying issue,
I have added the hotkey functionality. Just put your favorite button as the shortcut key for infinite fuel and you don't need to come
back to the application to apply the mod. Enter the race, wait a few seconds or play a few seconds and hit that shortcut key. Viola, Done!
Thank You..
